        With two important cup matches on the horizon over the course of the next six days, there is no time to dwell on last night’s draw against Southampton, says N’Golo Kante.
    </h2>
    <p style="margin-left:20%;width:50%;color:#0D417B">
        Maurizio Sarri’s side were forced to settle for a point in our opening fixture of 2019 as we were unable to make the breakthrough against a resolute Southampton side at Stamford Bridge.

        When chances did arrive, both Eden Hazard and Alvaro Morata found Angus Gunn, the visiting goalkeeper, in inspired form. Kante provided his thoughts on the evening’s events.

        ‘It was difficult to score, they played a good game defensively but we need to win and to find a way to score in this kind of game,’ he explained.

        ‘Just to keep going because we knew they were pressing a lot and we could find some spaces,’ Kante added, when asked about what Sarri had said to his team at the break. ‘We had some chances in the second half and we were unlucky not to score.’

        As well as being denied by Gunn, Morata had a 70th-minute goal ruled out for offside, adding to the sense of frustration.

        ‘We were a little bit unlucky because that was the kind of chance from which we can score,’ said Kante. ‘Maybe we need to find the right timing, but the game was a draw and now we need to bounce back in our next match, in the FA Cup, and in the semi-final of the Carabao Cup. We will see what we can do this week.’
